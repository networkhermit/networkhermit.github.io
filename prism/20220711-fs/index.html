            <blockquote>
<p><strong>1. Do Creative Work First</strong></p>
<p>The way I approach the problem of multiple priorities is by focusing on just one main metric: my
energy. I make choices that maximize my personal energy because that makes it easier to manage all
of the other priorities.</p>
<p>One of the most important tricks for maximizing your productivity involves matching your mental
state to the task.</p>
<p><strong>2. On Expecting People to Be Reasonable</strong></p>
<p>If your view of the world is that people use reason for their important decisions, you are setting
yourself up for a life of frustration and confusion. You’ll find yourself continually debating
people and never winning except in your own mind. Few things are as destructive and limiting as a
worldview that assumes people are mostly rational.</p>
<p><strong>3. The Most Important Form of Selfishness</strong></p>
<p>The most important form of selfishness involves spending time on your fitness, eating right,
pursuing your career, and still spending quality time with your family and friends.</p>
<p><strong>4. Withholding Praise is Immoral</strong></p>
<p>Children are accustomed to a continual stream of criticisms and praise, but adults can go weeks
without a compliment while enduring criticism both at work and at home. Adults are starved for a
kind word. When you understand the power of honest praise (as opposed to bullshitting, flattery,
and sucking up), you realize that withholding it borders on immoral. If you see something that
impresses you, a decent respect to humanity insists you voice your praise.</p>
<p><strong>5. Don’t Read the News for Truth</strong></p>
<p>I don’t read the news to find truth, as that would be a foolish waste of time. I read the news to
broaden my exposure to new topics and patterns that make my brain more efficient in general and to
enjoy myself, because learning interesting things increases my energy and makes me feel
optimistic.</p>
<p><strong>6. Fake it Till you Make it</strong></p>
<p>[W]e are designed to become in reality however we act. We fake it until it becomes real. Our core
personality doesn’t change, but we quickly adopt the mannerisms and skills associated with our new
status and position.</p>
<p><strong>7. Change Your Mind</strong></p>
<p>[Y]ou shouldn’t hesitate to modify your perceptions to whatever makes you happy, because you’re
probably wrong about the underlying nature of reality anyway.</p>
<p><strong>8. Systems Trump Goals</strong></p>
<p>If you do something every day, it’s a system. If you’re waiting to achieve it someday in the
future, it’s a goal.</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>[O]ne should have a system instead of a goal. The system-versus-goals model can be applied to most
human endeavours. In the world of dieting, losing twenty pounds is a goal, but eating right is a
system. In the exercise realm, running a marathon in under four hours is a goal, but exercising
daily is a system. In business, making a million dollars is a goal, but being a serial
entrepreneur is a system.</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>Goal-oriented people exist in a state of continuous pre-success failure at best, and permanent
failure at worst if things never work out. Systems people succeed every time they apply their
systems, in the sense that they did what they intended to do. The goals people are fighting the
feeling of discouragement at each turn. The systems people are feeling good every time they apply
their system. That’s a big difference in terms of maintaining your personal energy in the right
direction. …</p>
<p><strong>9. Psychology Matters</strong></p>
<p>On a scale of one to ten, the importance of understanding psychology is a solid ten.</p>
<p><strong>10. Consider How You Look</strong></p>
<p>Realistically, most people have poor filters for sorting truth from fiction, and there’s no
objective way to know if you’re particularly good at it or not. Consider the people who routinely
disagree with you. See how confident they look while being dead wrong? That’s exactly how you look
to them.</p>
