            <blockquote>
<p>Calling into the kernel is not like calling a normal function; a special trap into the kernel
must be triggered with the system-call arguments placed as the kernel expects. At a minimum, the
system-call &quot;wrapper&quot; provided by the C library must set up this trap. In many cases, more work
than that is required; the functionality provided by the kernel does not always exactly match
what the application (or the relevant standards) will expect. Features like POSIX threads further
complicate the situation. The end result is that a lot of work can be happening between the
application and the kernel when a system call is made. Doing that work is, in most cases,
delegated to the C library.</p>
<hr />
<p>Free-software projects tend to value their independence; their developers have little time for
others who would tell them what to do. But few projects truly stand alone. Whenever developers
decide to cooperate more fully with related projects, the result tends to be better software for
the community as a whole. The design and delivery of system calls would appear to be one of those
places where a higher level of communication and cooperation would be a healthy thing. That,
rather than trying to absorb low-level wrappers into the kernel project, seems like the proper
long-term solution to this problem.</p>
