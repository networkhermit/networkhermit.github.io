            <blockquote>
<p>Building infrastructure and operational expertise used to be bundled together into a single role.
But the industry is now bifurcating along an infrastructure fault line, and the overlap between
infrastructure-oriented engineers and operationally-minded engineers is swiftly eroding. Engineers
who love this work increasingly have a choice to make. Either you can 1) go deep on infrastructure
by joining a company that does infrastructure as a service, or 2) go broad on operability by
joining a company to help them do as little infrastructure as possible.</p>
<hr />
<p>Our systems are only getting more complex, more difficult to operate, and simultaneously more
critical to life on earth, which means that operational excellence has never been more desperately
needed (and if you donâ€™t respect that, ðŸŒˆ you deserve to suffer ðŸŒˆ).</p>
<hr />
<p>Developer cycles are the scarcest resource in your company, and you want to spend as many of those
as possible on your core product: the crown jewel, the code that makes you a business. Money is
cheaper than engineering cycles, and teams that are focused on their core business will always
outperform teams whose focus is spread across dozens of non-revenue-generating projects. Let
someone else build and run all the dependencies and adjacencies.</p>
<hr />
<h2 id="platform-engineering-is-what-stands-between-you-and-darkness">Platform engineering is what stands between you and darkness</h2>
<p>When you start talking about putting software engineers on call for their own code, and generally
being more involved in production, some percentage of the time you will hear back a guttural wail
of despair: <em>"You can't expect me to know EVERYTHING about EVERYTHING!"</em></p>
<p>Quite right; we canâ€™t. Platform engineering teams are part of the answer to this perfectly
reasonable complaint. Itâ€™s not that youâ€™re being asked to do or understand more <em>in toto</em>, but the
distribution of labor and responsibility is shifting:</p>
<p><strong>Before</strong>: some engineers wrote code, and some engineers ran code.</p>
<p><strong>Now</strong>: all engineers write code, and all engineers run the code they writeâ€”but we divide the areas
of responsibility by layer or function.</p>
<hr />
<p>One of the key principles of any developer platform is that <em>it should be easy to do the right
things, and hard to do the wrong things</em>. It should be much simpler and easier to use the blessed
paths than anything else, and there should be friction if you go off the beaten path.</p>
<hr />
<p><strong>A strong platform team has an equally deep grounding in operations experience and software
development.</strong> Individuals who are experts in both areas are fairly rare, but you can pull together
a strong, well-rounded <em>team</em> by assembling a mix of SWEs (with some ops experience) and ops or
DevOps engineers (with some software experience) and having them learn and grow from each other.</p>
<hr />
<p>Platform teams typically work higher up the stack than operations, DevOps, or SRE teams do, and
they involve a great deal less infrastructure.</p>
<p>If a company has both a DevOps team and SRE, typically I expect to see the SRE team more on the
frontlines, involved with incidents, telemetry, etc., and DevOps teams more on the backburner,
slinging pipes and plumbing.</p>
<hr />
<p>That team should write libraries, generate examples, and drive standardization; ushering in
consistency, predictability, and usability. They should partner with internal teams to evaluate
use cases. They should partner with your vendors as roadmap stakeholders. They might also write
glue code and helper modules to connect disparate data sources and create cohesive visualizations.
Basically, that team becomes an integration point between your organization and the outsourced
work.</p>
