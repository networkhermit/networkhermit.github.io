            <blockquote>
<p>Rule 1. You can't tell where a program is going to spend its time. Bottlenecks occur in surprising
places, so don't try to second guess and put in a speed hack until you've proven that's where the
bottleneck is.</p>
<p>Rule 2. Measure. Don't tune for speed until you've measured, and even then don't unless one part
of the code overwhelms the rest.</p>
<p>Rule 3. Fancy algorithms are slow when n is small, and n is usually small. Fancy algorithms have
big constants. Until you know that n is frequently going to be big, don't get fancy. (Even if n
does get big, use Rule 2 first.) For example, binary trees are always faster than splay trees for
workaday problems.</p>
<p>Rule 4. Fancy algorithms are buggier than simple ones, and they're much harder to implement. Use
simple algorithms as well as simple data structures.</p>
<p>The following data structures are a complete list for almost all practical programs:</p>
<ul>
<li>array</li>
<li>linked list</li>
<li>hash table</li>
<li>binary tree</li>
</ul>
<p>Of course, you must also be prepared to collect these into compound data structures. For instance,
a symbol table might be implemented as a hash table containing linked lists of arrays of
characters.</p>
<p>Rule 5. Data dominates. If you've chosen the right data structures and organized things well, the
algorithms will almost always be self-evident. Data structures, not algorithms, are central to
programming.</p>
<p>Rule 6. There is no Rule 6.</p>
