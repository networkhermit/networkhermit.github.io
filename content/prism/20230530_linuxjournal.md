> Although Bash is primarily a command interpreter, it's also a programming language. Bash supports
> variables, functions and has control flow constructs, such as conditional statements and loops.
> However, all of this comes with some unusual quirks. This is because Bash attempts to fulfill two
> roles at the same time: to be a command interpreter and a programming languageâ€”and there is
> tension between the two.
