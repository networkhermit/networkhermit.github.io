> The (big) ball on the left is rust-analyzer — a language server. The similarly sized ball on the right is VS Code — an editor. And the small ball in the center is the code to glue them together, *including* LSP implementations.
>
> That code is relatively and absolutely tiny. The codebases behind either the language server or the editor are enormous.
>
> ---
>
> To sum the above succinctly, the problem with decent IDE support was not of N * M, but rather of an inadequate equilibrium of a two-sided market.
>
> Language vendors were reluctant to create language servers, because it was hard, the demand was low (= no competition from other languages), and, even if one creates a language server, one would find a dozen editors absolutely unprepared to serve as a host for a smart server.
>
> On the editor’s side, there was little incentive for adding high-level APIs needed for IDEs, because there were no potential providers for those APIs.
>

>
> Action Item for Everyone: Please demand better IDE support!
