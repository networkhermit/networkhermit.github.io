> As computers share an increasing number of resources, memory has been given a new role. It is no longer simply a fast place to temporarily save code and data for a single processor, but is now blossoming into a role in which it also rapidly shares data between processors.
>
> This changes the memoryâ€™s role from fast temporary storage to one in which it serves as a communications medium. If we add in situ processing to that we find that memory begins to take on roles once devoted to processing and storage.
