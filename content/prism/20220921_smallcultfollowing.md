> The soul of Rust, to my mind, is definitely **not** being explicit about allocation. Rather, it’s
> about the struggle between a few key values — especially *productivity* and *versatility* in
> tension with *transparency*. Rust’s goal has always been to *feel* like a high-level but with the
> performance and control of a *low-level* one.

> * Transparency gives you control
> * Transparency can cost performance
> * Transparency hurts versatility and productivity
