> Building infrastructure and operational expertise used to be bundled together into a single role.
> But the industry is now bifurcating along an infrastructure fault line, and the overlap between
> infrastructure-oriented engineers and operationally-minded engineers is swiftly eroding. Engineers
> who love this work increasingly have a choice to make. Either you can 1) go deep on infrastructure
> by joining a company that does infrastructure as a service, or 2) go broad on operability by
> joining a company to help them do as little infrastructure as possible.

> Our systems are only getting more complex, more difficult to operate, and simultaneously more
> critical to life on earth, which means that operational excellence has never been more desperately

> Developer cycles are the scarcest resource in your company, and you want to spend as many of those

> ## Platform engineering is what stands between you and darkness

> When you start talking about putting software engineers on call for their own code, and generally
> being more involved in production, some percentage of the time you will hear back a guttural wail

> Quite right; we canâ€™t. Platform engineering teams are part of the answer to this perfectly
> reasonable complaint. Itâ€™s not that youâ€™re being asked to do or understand more *in toto*, but the
> distribution of labor and responsibility is shifting:
>
> **Before**: some engineers wrote code, and some engineers ran code.
>
> **Now**: all engineers write code, and all engineers run the code they writeâ€”but we divide the areas
> of responsibility by layer or function.

> One of the key principles of any developer platform is that *it should be easy to do the right
> things, and hard to do the wrong things*. It should be much simpler and easier to use the blessed
> paths than anything else, and there should be friction if you go off the beaten path.

> **A strong platform team has an equally deep grounding in operations experience and software
> development.** Individuals who are experts in both areas are fairly rare, but you can pull together
> a strong, well-rounded *team* by assembling a mix of SWEs (with some ops experience) and ops or
> DevOps engineers (with some software experience) and having them learn and grow from each other.

> Platform teams typically work higher up the stack than operations, DevOps, or SRE teams do, and
> they involve a great deal less infrastructure.
>
> If a company has both a DevOps team and SRE, typically I expect to see the SRE team more on the
> frontlines, involved with incidents, telemetry, etc., and DevOps teams more on the backburner,
> slinging pipes and plumbing.

> That team should write libraries, generate examples, and drive standardization; ushering in
> consistency, predictability, and usability. They should partner with internal teams to evaluate
> use cases. They should partner with your vendors as roadmap stakeholders. They might also write
> glue code and helper modules to connect disparate data sources and create cohesive visualizations.
> Basically, that team becomes an integration point between your organization and the outsourced
> work.
