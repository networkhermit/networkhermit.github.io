> Using a large chunk of receive buffer space for the metadata is not really what the programmer

> intention of freeing some space. One of the operations is `tcp_collapse` and it will merge
> adjacent TCP packets into one larger `sk_buff`. This behavior is pretty much a garbage collection
> (GC)â€”and as everyone knows, when the garbage collection kicks in, the latency must spike.

> You can't have a very large number of bound TCP sockets and we learned that the hard way. We
