> Our growth strategy is obviously not about making profit, but we are a small team at the centre of
> government and we need to make sure our people and our money are focused on services that have the
> biggest reach and the most impact.
>
> The big cloud providers (AWS, Azure, GCP and others) have upped their game and reduced the
> barriers to entry for digital teams.
>
> GOV.UK PaaS has not seen the rapid and continued growth that we’ve seen with some of our other
> platform products, and is now at a point where we either invest heavily in some significant
> technical architecture changes, or we make the difficult decision to sunset the product.
