> Developer observability is a new pillar of observability adapted for the needs of developers.
> Unlike typical observability solutions, it’s aimed directly at developers and not at DevOps. As
> such, it provides a direct connection between the source code and the observable production.

> A good analogy would be that developer observability is like a debugger whereas current
> observability tools are like a profiler. When you run with a debugger, it doesn’t do much until
> you add breakpoints to extract information. A profiler constantly gets information while running.
> Both are very useful and both serve different use cases.

> Some of you might have read this article thinking about remote debugging. This has many

> breakpoint on the user authentication code and siphoning off user credentials.
