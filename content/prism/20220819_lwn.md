>  Calling into the kernel is not like calling a normal function; a special trap into the kernel
>  must be triggered with the system-call arguments placed as the kernel expects. At a minimum, the
>  system-call "wrapper" provided by the C library must set up this trap. In many cases, more work
>  than that is required; the functionality provided by the kernel does not always exactly match
>  what the application (or the relevant standards) will expect. Features like POSIX threads further
>  complicate the situation. The end result is that a lot of work can be happening between the
>  application and the kernel when a system call is made. Doing that work is, in most cases,
>  delegated to the C library.
